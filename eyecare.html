<h1>What we offer</h1>

<h2>Eyecare</h2>

<p>At C Wel Optometry, we provide comprehensive, detailed eye examinations where we check the prescription of the eyes as well as routinely look for any signs of eye health problems. The majority of eye health issues rely on early detection and prevention, so it is recommended to have a routine full eye test done every 2 years. With certain eye conditions it may even be recommended to have a test every year instead. As part of the eye examination, we take a detailed patient history to find and address any concerns and we will attempt to find the best possible solution. As an independent optometry store, we are able to provide a wider range of products and services to find the best solution for the patient’s needs.
</p>
<p>
  As part of our thorough eye examination and management we offer the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#OCT">Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT)</a></li>
  <li><a href="#lenses">A wide range of Frames and Lenses for spectacles</a></li>
  <li><a href="#contacts">Contact Lenses</a></li>
  <li><a href="#myopia">Myopia Control</a></li>
  <li><a href="#orthok">Orthokeratology</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We will always try to put the needs of the patient first where possible and will often recommend different options and educate the patient on the pros and cons of each alternative. Sometimes this might be overwhelming, but we like to involve the patient in the decision making process. However, if necessary, we can consider all the important factors and come up with what we feel is the best option.
</p>

<h2 id="OCT">Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT)</h2>
<p>Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a powerful diagnostic tool that can be used to evaluate and manage various eye conditions such as glaucoma and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). It is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides detailed cross-sectional images of the retina, in particular the optic nerve head and macula. While we look at the retina from a surface perspective as part of the routine eye test, the OCT can delve deeper so to detect issues beneath the retina.
</p>
<p>OCT is primarily used for evaluating the health of the retina. It can help detect and monitor conditions such as macular swelling which can occur in cases of macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and central serous retinopathy. It can also detect conditions such as macula holes and epiretinal membranes. Another essential use of OCT is to help to diagnose and monitor glaucoma. It measures the thickness of the retinal nerve fibre layer and compares the patient’s results to an extensive database matching for age, sex and ethnicity. Using this comparison, we can help to assess optic nerve health and detect thinning of this layer, which is indicative of glaucoma progression.</p>

<h2 id="lenses">Lenses </h2>
<p>As an independent optometry practice, we can offer more choices to suit the patient’s individual needs. We are able to offer high quality lenses from lens companies such as HOYA (Japan), Essilor (France) and Rodenstock (Germany). Every company has lenses with different advantages, and we will offer the most suitable lens option with the best quality coatings where possible. We can also accommodate patients with specific preferences in lens type or brands to the best of our ability.
</p>
<p>Different types of spectacle lenses include single vision, bifocal, multifocal as well as myopia control lens.</p>
<h4>Single vision lenses</h4>
<p>
Single vision lenses are lenses designed to correct one specific vision problem- generally Distance, Near or Intermediate. These lenses allow correction for myopia (shortsightedness), hyperopia (longsightedness) and astigmatism.</p>
<h4>Bifocal lenses</h4>
<p>Bifocal lenses are lenses designed to correct two different vision problems- generally Distance and Near. They have two distinct areas on the lens, each with a different prescription power and are suitable for patients with presbyopia and require two specific viewing distances. They are sometimes confused with multifocal lenses but are easily distinguishable by their appearance.</p>
<h4>Multifocal/Progressive lenses</h4>
<p>Multifocal lenses, also commonly known as progressive lenses, are lenses designed to correct vision problems at multiple distances. They are suitable mostly for patients with presbyopia but can also be for patients who suffer from eye strain and eye fatigue from near tasks. Unlike traditional bifocal lenses, multifocal lenses do have any visible lines or segments which allows the smoother transition between different powers.</p>
<p>
  Multifocal lenses are highly customised lenses and every lens company’s multifocal lenses are different. Even within each company there are multiple multifocal lens designs. We offer high quality multifocal lenses which will best suit your needs.
  </p>

  <h2 id="contacts">Contact lenses</h2>
  <p>Contact lenses are a popular alternative to spectacles and while it can be used to correct vision problems such as shortsightedness, longsightedness, astigmatism and presbyopia, it can also be used in complex eye conditions such as keratoconus, corneal grafts and myopia control. There are several types of contact lenses, each designed to meet specific needs and preferences.</p>
  <h4>Soft lenses</h4>
  <p>Typically made from a flexible, water-absorbing hydrogel or silicone hydrogel material, these lenses are often pre-made and come in daily, fortnightly and monthly varieties. Daily lenses are worn for a day then discarded while fortnightly and monthly lenses can be used for up to 2 weeks or a month. They are recommended to be removed and thoroughly cleaned and stored every night for their wearing period.</p>
  <h4>Hard Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) lenses</h4>
  <p>These lenses are custom-made from a rigid, oxygen-permeable material. They generally require very precise measurements to cater for each individual patient. They have a variety of uses: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Correcting high levels of shortsightedness, longsightedness and astigmatism.    </li>
    <li>Correcting eye condition with irregular corneas such as keratoconus and corneal grafts. Hard lenses in these cases provide users with much better vision than glasses and soft contact lenses. Sometimes certain cases require scleral or mini-scleral lenses which are large lenses which cover the whole cornea.</li>
    <li>Orthokeratology (Ortho-K/OK lens) which allow users to avoid using any glasses or contact lenses during the day by wearing hard lenses which reshape the cornea while sleeping. They have been described as “braces for the eyes” as they do not permanent alter the eyes. OK lenses are also used as a method to slow myopia progression in children.
    </li>
    
  </ul>

  <h2 id="myopia">Myopia Control</h2>
  <p>Myopia (also known as shortsightedness or nearsightedness) is where light entering the eye is focused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. It is typically caused by the elongation of the eyeball which is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. As we cannot change the former, we can attempt to alter the latter which is greatly influenced by spending a lot of time doing close tasks, such as reading, computers, tablets and phones.</p>
  <p>
    Myopia often starts during childhood and progresses as children grow. The eye may elongate as a child's body grows, leading to increasing levels of shortsightedness. What is most important about myopia progression is not just the inconvenience of needing thicker lenses as the prescription increases. High myopia, if not managed properly, can increase the risk of other eye conditions, such as retinal detachment, glaucoma and cataracts. This is why it's essential to monitor progression especially in children where it can change rapidly.

  </p>
  <p>Currently we have a few strategies to help slow down myopia progression in children. We can offer a variety of treatments but will recommend those that are currently proven to be the most effective, although the research and data is constantly changing. They include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Orthokeratology (Ortho-K/OK lens): Special hard contact lenses worn at night while sleeping to reshape the cornea and temporarily reduce myopia during the day.
    </li>
    <li>Low dose Atropine eye drops: Specially compounded low concentration of Atropine eye drops (generally 0.01% to 0.05%), typically instilled at night.
    </li>
    <li>Defocus Incorporated Multiple Segments (DIMS) lenses: Special HOYA lenses with technology designed to slow down myopia progression.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="orthok">Orthokeratology (Ortho-K/OK lens)</h2>
  <p>Orthokeratology lenses, also known as Ortho-K or OK lenses, are a specialised and reversible method of vision correction that primarily addresses myopia (shortsightedness). Described as “braces for the eyes”, they slowly shape the cornea of the eye to the desired level. Ortho-K correction involves using a specially designed hard rigid gas permeable contact lenses worn overnight during sleep to provide clear vision during the day without the need of any spectacles or contact lenses. While this is the main effect of OK lenses, they are also often used for their secondary effect of reducing myopia progression in children.
  </p>
  <p>What is the process?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>During the initial consultation we will do a standard full eye examination to check the patient’s vision and eye health. Using this information, we can determine if the patient is eligible for OK lenses as well as discuss the other options available.
    </li>
    <li>During the first Ortho-K consultation, we will do corneal topography to take a map of the patient’s cornea. This accurately measures the unique parameters of the patient so we can design a fully customised lens to fit these requirements.
    </li>
    <li>After the lenses are made, the patient is required to have an appointment where we teach the patient and/or the patient’s guardians how to insert and remove the lens. We will teach the patient how to clean and take care of the lens, as well as take some extra measurements to verify the fit. We recommend the patient to wear this lens overnight, hopefully having 8 hours of sleep and to come in for an appointment the following morning.</li>
<li>The following morning the patient is recommended to come in wearing the Ortho-K lenses if possible so we can provide an assessment on how the lens has worked overnight while also addressing any issues the patient may have over the night. If there are no issues and the lens is working as desired, we have completed the fit. We still require further appointments at regular intervals to assess that the lens is functioning as desired. If at any time the vision is not ideal, the fit may need to be adjusted for as long as necessary to achieve the target.
